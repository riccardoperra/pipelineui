# PipelineUI

Pipeline UI is a visual editor for creating and managing GitHub Actions workflows.
Built with SolidStart, this tool simplifies the process of defining GitHub pipelines
by allowing users to visually edit and update workflows. It automatically generates and
updates the YAML configuration files, ensuring seamless integration with GitHub.

## ðŸ¤– Tech stack

PipelineUI is entirely built with Solid and [SolidStart](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start).

There are a few core external dependencies that should be listed here for the awesome work.

### UI

The UI has been built with:

- [@kobalte/core](https://github.com/kobaltedev/kobalte): used to build accessible components in the UI
- [@solid-primitives/*](https://github.com/solidjs-community/solid-primitives): SolidJS primitives library
- [vanilla-extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/): Zero-runtime CSS in typescript
- [corvu](https://corvu.dev/): UI primitives for SolidJS

> [!WARNING]
>
> The source code of @actions/workflow-parser has been altered in order to be built into node/browser without getting errors and to
> extend some functionalities that were not available before (e.g. expression parsing).
> 
> Currently @actions/languageserver has been wrapped to ship only browser compatible packages and the patche workflow-parser in order to skip all the used node dependencies.
>
> Read more about this in the package [README](./packages/workflow-parser/README.md).

### YAML Editor

- [CodeMirror6](https://codemirror.net/): used to display the YAML editor and merge view. The LSP integration is an
  adapted fork of [codemirror-languageserver](https://github.com/FurqanSoftware/codemirror-languageserver), which was a
  good starting point to integrate the GitHub workflow language server.
- [actions/languageservices](https://github.com/actions/languageservices): The language service repo for GitHub
  workflows and expressions. This was used to parse the workflow files and validate them, and enhance the editor code
  through linting and hover-in code documentation.

### Flow diagram

Flow diagram has been built from scratch taking advantage of some other dependencies:

- [elkjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs): Elk layout algorithm, used to calculate the flow item positions
- [panzoom](https://github.com/anvaka/panzoom): Cross-browser compatible pan and zoom library
- [@xyflow/system](): Core of xyflow, currently used to build the smooth edge curve
  svg (https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow/blob/97fdff59d40071aee0b3192f7b571c6bdd4d09fd/packages/system/src/utils/edges/smoothstep-edge.ts#L215)

### Backend

The UI has been built with:

- [@kobalte/core](https://github.com/kobaltedev/kobalte): used to build accessible components in the UI
- [@solid-primitives/*](https://github.com/solidjs-community/solid-primitives): SolidJS primitives library
- [vanilla-extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/): Zero-runtime CSS in typescript
- [corvu](https://corvu.dev/): UI primitives for SolidJS

Backend has been built with [appwrite](https://appwrite.io/), which has been wrapped via solid server functions
to provide authentication and the database persistence.

### Other dependencies

This projects also uses some of mine older dependencies that which were used to speed up the writing of the application.
These have also been updated to fix the bugs encountered.

- [@codeui/kit](https://github.com/riccardoperra/codeui): [CodeImage](https://github.com/riccardoperra/codeimage) design
  system which wraps Kobalte.
- [statebuilder](https://github.com/riccardoperra/statebuilder): Pluggable state management
- [solid-codemirror](https://github.com/riccardoperra/solid-codemirror): SolidJS adapter for CodeMirror
